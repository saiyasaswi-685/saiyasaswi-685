Hello! I'm Sai Yasaswi, a passionate and dedicated **3rd year CSE student** at **Aditya College of Engineering and Technology, Surampalem**. I'm on a mission to build a strong foundation in cloud computing and software development.

Currently, I'm focused on learning **AWS cloud services** â€” Iâ€™ve already explored core concepts like **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)** and **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**. I love applying what I learn to real-world projects and challenges.

## ðŸ’¡ Skills & Tools

## ðŸŽ¶ Beyond Code

When I'm not coding or exploring the cloud, youâ€™ll find me playing the piano or immersed in music. I believe creativity fuels both my technical and personal growth.
